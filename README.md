# Doc-Chain
In today’s digital world there are a lot of issues in verifying the legitimacy of documents that an individual provides such as School/College mark sheets, Course certificates, etc. 
Companies are concerned whether a certificate provided to them is legit or forged. 
Verifying these documents manually or by offline visits is a tedious procedure and takes days to complete. 
The use of physical documents is also inconvenient and inefficient in today’s fast paced digital world. 
To counter this forgery issue a platform using blockchain technology is suggested. 
Blockchain provides immutability, once the document is uploaded to the blockchain it cannot be tampered with. 
Doc-Chain is a Blockchain platform for universities to securely store student marksheets and certificates.
